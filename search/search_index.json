Discovery Implicit Discovery We have introduced a proprietary comfort feature that allows asset links to be retrieved without or in addition to an existing \"standard\" discovery. Our Implicit Discovery works directly on the tenant's existing asset administration shell repository data and creates shell descriptors on-the-fly when called. The advantage of this feature is that all shells of your shell repository are hereby discoverable by default - without the need of explicitly entering lookup data into a discovery. The limitation of it is that only those \"local shell\" are discoverable and the quantity cannot be restricted or extended to shells of further (external) repositories. For distributed scenarios you need to use a standard discovery.

Shell Registry Implicit Shell Registry We have introduced a proprietary comfort feature that allows shell descriptors to be retrieved without or in addition to an existing \"standard\" shell registry. Our Implicit Shell Registry works directly on the tenant's existing asset administration shell repository data and creates basic shell descriptors on-the-fly when called. The advantage of this feature is that all shells of your shell repository are hereby registered by default - without the need of explicitly entering descriptors into a registry. The limitation of it is that only local shells are retrievable and their quantity cannot be restricted or extended to shells of further (external) repositories. For distributed scenarios you need to use a standard registry. You might think: What a pointless feature - after all, you are asking a twinsphere tenant where a shell is located that is hosted by this very tenant. So the answer you'll get will always be \"The shell is here with me!\". However, the advantage of this approach lies in simple client-centered use cases, where clients are able to follow the standard call procedure (Discovery => Registry => Shell => Submodel) without you having to deal with shell registrations. The endpoints of our Implicit Shell Registry feature correspond to the IDTA read service profile SSP-002 of the Discovery Service Specification and are located at the top level of our api path: https:// {twinsphereTenantURL} /api/ {api_version} /shell-descriptors Standard (\"Explicit\") Shell Registry Of course twinsphere also offers the official Asset Administration Shell Registry service as specified.

Shell Repository Enhanced GET /shells We have introduced an optional extra query parameter \"assetKind\" for filtering shells according to their asset kind. Presently, the available asset kinds include: Instance Type You can utilize this parameter within your existing /shells calls to filter based on the asset kind. If this parameter isn't provided, all shells, regardless of their asset kind, will be returned. Due to its optional nature, the parameter is a non-breaking extension of the standard. Submodel Repository Enhanced GET /submodels We have introduced an optional extra query parameter \"kind\" for filtering submodels according to their kind. Presently, the available kinds include: Instance Template You can utilize this parameter within your existing /submodels calls to filter based on the kind. If this parameter isn't provided, all submodels, regardless of their kind, will be returned. Due to its optional nature, the parameter is a non-breaking extension of the standard. Concept Description Repository Available and works :) Nothing special beyond the defined standard to document here. File Repository twinsphere is self-sufficiently capable of hosting and managing files and documents to be referenced from any submodel within your tenant. twinsphere File Paths The key concept behind the file repository are so called 'twinsphere file paths' (tfp). This feature enables clients to reuse and share files between shells and submodels, eliminating the need to upload the same files multiple times. A tfp follows a fixed format/pattern, for example: file:/dHdpbnNwaGVyZS1maWxl/cp/18ef5516-618b-4a97-ac4b-d47f5d5ee823/thumbnail.jpg . It follows the file URI scheme (as requested by the specifications in advance to v3.1) and consists of a static part, the tenant name, a unique documentId, and a file name. This tfp cannot be generated by the client. It is created by twinsphere when uploading a file to the repository (see Usage below) and should be (re)used in submodels when referencing a file resources. Please notice A tfp is only valid in the context of a single tenant and is not reachable from outside this context. Usage of File API twinsphere's file repository is accessible via the \"files\" endpoints at https://{tenant_url}/api/v3.0/files\u2026 Once a file has been uploaded to the file repository it can be referenced by shells (as thumbnail) or submodels (as attachment) using its corresponding tfp. We recommend the following procedure: POST /files to upload a document, tfp is returned Remember the tfp and use it as File.value in submodels as required Please notice There is currently no way to search for a tfp in the file repository, as no metadata about the file is stored apart from the file name - and this may not be unique in the repository. Replacing an existing file by PUT /files will replace the files content while keeping its filename and tfp. So all reference stay valid and now point to the new content. To remove a file physically from the repository, you have to use the DELETE /files interface. Please be aware that there is no check for existing references, so you may create invalid reference by deleting a file. You can attach meta information to a twinsphere file at https://{tenant_url}/sphere/api/v1.0/files/{tfp}/metadata endpoint. { \"displayName\": \"Document Display Name\", \"classification\": \"01-01\", \"attributes\": { { \"key\": \"external-id\", \"value\": \"1\" }, { \"key\": \"country\", \"value\": \"germany\" }, { \"key\": \"priority\", \"value\": \"important\" } } } displayName : Custom name for the file. classification : Must be a valid class ID as defined in VDI 2770 . Attributes : Custom key\u2013value metadata. Attributes Limit : Up to 50 attributes per file. Attribute Size : Keys and values can each be up to 2048 characters. Adaption of standard operations The introduction of our file repository made it necessary to adapt the behavior of standard operations working with files: DELETE /attachment and DELETE /thumbnail Only removes file references from SM/AAS. Deletion of file itself is only possible via DELETE /files (see above) PUT /attachment and PUT /thumbnail Uploads new file to repo and updates this single reference with new twinsphere File Path. Former file stays unchanged, still exists on file repo and its twinsphere File Path is still valid. All other references to the former file stay untouched. GET /serialization for AASX packages Packs all referenced files of resolvable tfps (file exists in tenant's file repository) and ignores invalid twinsphere File Paths (non-existing files) Implications of this adapted behavior: If you (re-)upload a thumbnail or attachment via standard endpoints all referencing shells/submodels which used the previous file must be updated as well to use the updated file. A better way to update all references of an old file is to reupload the file via PUT /files. Its filename cannot be changed in this way though. If you update the thumbnail or attachment file value/path entry in the metamodel to something that does not resemble a twinsphere file path (e.g., file:/aasx/file/thumbnail.jpg ), the download of the file will no longer work. If you update references to a file in a single submodel element (with \"PUT attachment\" or \"PUT thumbnail\"), all other references will still be valid but are not updated and point to the former file. Import An AASX package can be uploaded via the import function. Currently, only one shell is supported. The import process is not transactional, so the shell, submodels, and files may be partially created even in the event of an error. It is important to note that an import always overwrites existing data. A package is considered valid if: Successful validation Exactly one shell Other elements are optional If a thumbnail is required, an asset thumbnail must be provided. Package thumbnails are ignored. Currently, there is a limitation in \"[Content_Types].xml\". All paths are case-sensitive and must exactly match the folder path within the package. Serialization /serialization The serialization endpoint returns an environment that contains specified asset administration shells, submodels and concept descriptions (see part 2 of the AAS specification \u29c9 ). The desired return type can be specified using the \"Accept\" header parameter of the request. Valid return types include application/xml (default), application/json , and application/asset-administration-shell-package+json . Packages currently contain the environment as JSON \u2013 XML coming soon. Note If you use the serialization in the Swagger UI there is one problem, you cannot set the accept header in the UI. You have to go down to the Responses section and there, in the 200 section, choose the accept header value from the drop down and send the request. Now you will get your correct serialized shell. As mentioned in this issue on github \u29c9 , this is a Swagger UI / OpenApi problem and can not be fixed. As mentioned in this issue on github \u29c9 , Swagger UI produces an corrupt File on using the Accept Header \" application/asset-administration-shell-package+json \". Using the API direct with for example Postman or CURL gives the correct File. Serialization Modifiers Level Modifier Not yet available, coming soon... Content Modifier You can use special content modifiers to get special serializations of the requested data, e.g. only the metadata of an object. Metadata ($metadata) From IDTA Spec Part 2: \"Only metadata of an element or child elements is returned; the value is not.\" This is implemented for the following endpoints: GET /submodel/{submodelIdentifier}/$metadata Let us give you an example for this endpoint with the nameplate submodel. { \"idShort\": \"Nameplate\", \"id\": \"https://company.com/ids/sm/nameplate\", \"kind\": \"Instance\", \"semanticId\": { \"type\": \"ExternalReference\", \"keys\": [ { \"type\": \"GlobalReference\", \"value\": \"https://admin-shell.io/zvei/nameplate/2/0/Nameplate\" } ] }, \"modelType\": \"Submodel\" } Value ($value) Not yet available, coming soon... Reference ($reference) This gives you the Reference object of an object or a list of reference objects on endpoints which works with many objects. For example the shellIds of all shells in your repository. From IDTA Spec Part 2: \"Only applicable to Referables. Only the reference to the found element is returned; potential child elements are ignored.\" Actually it is not implemented for the for the Asset Administration Shell and Submodel endpoints /shells/{aasIdentifier}/$reference /shells/{aasIdentifier}/submodels/{submodelIdentifier}/$reference /shells/{aasIdentifier}/submodels/{submodelIdentifier}/submodel-elements/{idShortPath}/$reference Path ($path) From IDTA Spec Part 2: \"Returns the idShort of the requested element and a list of idShort paths to child elements if the requested element is a Submodel, a SubmodelElementCollection, a SubmodelElementList, a AnnotatedRelationshipElement, or an Entity.\" This is implemented for the following endpoints: GET /submodel/{submodelIdentifier}/$path The return value for our Nameplate Submodel would be: [ \"URIOfTheProduct\", \"ManufacturerName\", \"ManufacturerProductDesignation\", \"ContactInformation\", \"ContactInformation.Company\", \"ContactInformation.CityTown\", \"ContactInformation.Phone\", \"ContactInformation.Phone.TelephoneNumber\", \"ContactInformation.Phone.TypeOfTelephone\", \"ContactInformation.Fax\", \"ContactInformation.Fax.FaxNumber\", \"ContactInformation.Fax.TypeOfFaxNumber\", \"ContactInformation.Street\", \"ContactInformation.Zipcode\", \"ContactInformation.AddressOfAdditionalLink\", \"ManufacturerProductRoot\", \"ManufacturerProductFamily\", \"OrderCodeOfManufacturer\", \"ProductArticleNumberOfManufacturer\", \"Markings\", \"Markings.Marking01\", \"Markings.Marking01.MarkingName\", \"Markings.Marking02\", \"Markings.Marking02.MarkingName\", \"Markings.Marking03\", \"Markings.Marking03.MarkingName\" ] Extent Modifier Only applicable to BLOB elements. The \"extent\" parameter controls whether embedded data is returned in base64 format or not. By default, if the parameter is not provided, no embedded data is returned. The possible values are \"WithBLOBValue\" and \"WithoutBLOBValue\". The default is \"WithoutBlobValue\". There are only a few submodels that have BLOBs inside. But we can give you a generally example how the result with this modifier will look like. The name of the BLOB is \"Library\". Please note that this modifier is given as a query parameter on the endpoints. This is implemented for the following endpoints: GET /submodel/{submodelIdentifier}?extent= WithoutBLOBValue { \"Library\": { \"contentType\": \"application/octet-stream\" } } WithBLOBValue { \"Library\": { \"contentType\": \"application/octet-stream\" \"value\": \"VGhpcyBpcyBteSBibG9i\" } } Pagination Some data can be retrieved page by page. For this, you can pass a limit and a cursor. The limit determines the maximum size of a page, and the cursor specifies the position from which data retrieval starts. The result object of such a request contains the cursor value for the next request/page under paging_metadata.cursor. Interface example: public async Task<IActionResult> GetAllAssetAdministrationShells( [FromQuery] List<string>? assetIds = null, [FromQuery] string? idShort = null, [FromQuery] int? limit = null, [FromQuery] string? cursor = null, [FromQuery] Core.AssetKind? assetKind = null) Result Model: { \"result\": {}, \"paging_metadata\": { \"cursor\": \"\" } }","title":"API Documentation"},{"location":"cloud-documentation/#api-documentation","text":"This documentation complements the swagger documentation of our API and contains addition information and background to the endpoints.","title":"API Documentation"},{"location":"cloud-documentation/#discovery","text":"","title":"Discovery"},{"location":"cloud-documentation/#implicit-discovery","text":"We have introduced a proprietary comfort feature that allows asset links to be retrieved without or in addition to an existing \"standard\" discovery.

A better way to update all references of an old file is to reupload the file via PUT /files. Its filename cannot be changed in this way though.

Note Submodel element operations do not produce any events! Besides the HTTP/REST based API endpoint, twinsphere also offers a MQTT based API for receiving events about shells and submodels. Configuration All shell changes are published. Submodel events are published only for configured semantic IDs. This configuration can be modified in the \"Events\" section of the /sphere/swagger/index.html . The default configuration will look something like this: { \"publish\": { \"submodels\": { \"semanticIds\": [ \"https://admin-shell.io/zvei/nameplate/1/0/ContactInformations\", \"0173-1#01-AHF578#001\", \"0173-1#01-AHF578#003\", \"https://admin-shell.io/zvei/nameplate/2/0/Nameplate\", \"https://admin-shell.io/idta/nameplate/3/0/Nameplate\", \"https://admin-shell.io/ZVEI/TechnicalData/Submodel/1/2\", \"0173-1#01-AHX837#002\" ] } } } Per default, only the common submodels (nameplate / handover docs / tech data) are included. Regex To use regular expressions instead of exact matches, prefix your semantic ID with \" $regex= \" and provide a valid regex expression. If you need to use special characters in your pattern (such as $ / . @ > ) you'll need to escape them with double backslashes (\\\\). For example, to match all submodels whose Semantic ID includes \"test\": { \"publish\": { \"submodels\": { \"semanticIds\": [ \"$regex=^test$\" ] } } } Multiple regex expressions, as well as matching with static strings, is possible. Connecting to the broker Connection is based on mutual-TLS authentication with certificates. At present, we only support the thumbprint matching strategy. Certificate creation Create your own certificate (it can be self-signed or issued by a valid certificate authority, but ensure you store this certificate securely as a SECRET ). You can simply follow this guide \u29c9 or use a tool of your choice. Send us the thumbprint via a JIRA ticket request . We will provide you with the connection details once the thumbprint has been granted access. The thumbprint itself is not a secret, so it can be sent through unsecured channels. To test out the connection, we recommend using mqttx.app \u29c9 Connecting Any MQTT 3.1 or 5.0 client library in any language is supported. Make sure you understand and distinguish between the MQTT client ID (aka Session ID) and the username which you need to provide, like in WithCredentials() method in the C# example below. Your client ID (session ID) can have any value, but make sure it is fixed and not dynamic. This value will be used to map the MQTT session back to your client in cases such as restarts and failures. Here is a generic C# example with MQTTNet on how to establish a connection: const string clientId = \"your-fixed-client-id-per-consumer\"; // aka Session ID const string username = \"you will get this value from us\"; var mqttClientConfiguration = new MqttClientOptionsBuilder() .WithClientId(clientId) .WithTcpServer(_eventBrokerHost, _eventBrokerPort) ... .WithCredentials(username, \"\") Single connections Most common case will be that you subscribe to events in a single-instance with a fixed clientId (any value as long as it is fixed between deployments and restarts). In case of rolling deployments, you don't necessarily need to disconnect the \"old\" client first. The old client will automatically get a disconnect once the new client connect with the same username / clientId combination. Multiple connections For cases where you want to have multiple concurrent connections, we support up to 3 concurrent sessions per \"username\". You can refer to Microsoft docs \u29c9 on some session ID / client ID naming patterns in case of multiple concurrent connections. Topics, message contracts and QoS Following MQTT topics are supported: twinsphere/shells/<shell id - base64 encoded!>/created twinsphere/shells/<shell id - base64 encoded!>/updated twinsphere/shells/<shell id - base64 encoded!>/deleted twinsphere/submodels/<submodel id - base64 encoded!>/created twinsphere/submodels/<submodel id - base64 encoded!>/updated twinsphere/submodels/<submodel id - base64 encoded!>/deleted MQTT wildcards for subscriptions are supported at the \"id\" level, for example, to subscribe to all shell update events, use: twinsphere/shells/+/updated Messages are delivered with a QoS of 1 (at-least-once) , which means that duplicates are possible and should be expected. The MQTT message content (referred to here as the twinsphere envelope) follows the schema below: # shell event envelope version: string timestamp: string (UTC in ISO 8601 format) payload: JSON string (aas-core-works AssetAdministationShell meta model) # submodel event envelope version: string timestamp: string (UTC in ISO 8601 format) payload: JSON string (aas-core-works Submodel meta model) affectedShellIds: JSON array of strings containing shells this submodel referenced at the time The envelope is always compressed via gzip , so you should first decompress it. Then, to deserialize the JSON string in the payload property, you can use the aas-core-works libraries for your target programming language or platform. Below is a code snippet demonstrating how you could achieve this in C#: // If you are using MQTTnet, then your MQTT message (MqttApplicationMessage) should have a // property called PayloadSegment. Using the extension method Decompress, defined below, // you can do something like this: var envelopeJson = msg.PayloadSegment.ToArray().Decompress(); var envelope = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ShellEvent>(envelopeJson); // now you can read envelope.Payload, which is a JSON structure that can be deserialized via // core-works Jsonization helper from the https://github.com/aas-core-works/aas-core3.0-csharp // you need a \"container\" to deserialize into - this is our envelope public class ShellEvent { [JsonPropertyName(\"version\")] public required string Version { get; init; } [JsonPropertyName(\"timestamp\")] public required string Timestamp { get; init; } [JsonPropertyName(\"payload\")] public required string Payload { get; init; } } public static string Decompress(this byte[] compressedContent) { using var compressedStream = new MemoryStream(compressedContent); using var gzipStream = new GZipStream(compressedStream, CompressionMode.Decompress); using var decompressedStream = new MemoryStream(); gzipStream.CopyTo(decompressedStream); var decompressedBytes = decompressedStream.ToArray(); return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decompressedBytes); } To properly handle possible duplicate events on your side, make sure to use the timestamp property and ignore messages newer than the timestamp you already processed. MQTT protocol details For information on supported MQTT versions and limitations on MQTT features, please refer to this resource . Equally important are the quotas & limitations . Especially important is to mention the limitations of the persistent sessions which is up to 100 messages / 8h per topic. Additional information There are several important aspects to note regarding the twinsphere interface: Events published are not issued immediately after a change is made via the REST API, there can be a delay of up to several minutes. Duplicate events should be expected, and are commonplace when using QoS 1. Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues, we recommend enabling tracing of MQTT messages depending on the library you are using. For example, on the .NET Platform using MQTTNet, you can enable traces like this .

Target management Target management is performed through /sphere/push/targets/* endpoints. To create or update a target, use the /sphere/push/targets/{name} endpoint (you need to choose a name for the target yourself), and post the JSON configuration as the body depending on the target itself (see supported targets below). Please note that all connection information of targets will be handled as secret by twinsphere and only stored in encrypted form. Note Please make sure that the target is reachable from the internet! Supported Targets Azure Blob Storage To connect to the Azure Blob Storage, you need to create a Blob container in advance. Please issue a Shared access token with full rights and insert the \"Blob SAS URL\" with the configuration body as in the example below: { \"name\": \"{your-custom-target-name}\", \"type\": \"azure-blob-storage\", \"configuration\": { \"blobContainerSasUrl\": \"...\" } } Note blobContainerSasUrl should include the http target, blob container name and the secret required for the connection!

A list of defined indexes and their schema is given below. Each index is language-specific and contains only strings in a given language. We currently support English (en-US) and German (de-DE) languages only. To search using one of the indexes, send a query via POST on the /api/v3/sphere/search endpoint. Take a look at the Swagger for more API documentation around each parameter and return value. Shell Technical classifications Index names: English: search_shell_technical_classifications_en_index German: search_shell_technical_classifications_de_index When writing queries, you need to include the language in both the index name and as a query string parameter for the HTTP request! Defined mappings : name field type explanation classifications token Classifications is an array of string identifiers. properties stringFacet Properties in an array so that you can perform facet queries to find most used properties. 0 ... N properties extracted from the technical data submodels token, stringFacet Indexed as token to be used for filtering, and as a stringFacet to enable facets for each property. Data returned in the queries as results looks something like this (based on the language, example for German): { \"_id\": \"shell-id-1\", \"classifications\": [ \"24-11\", \"24-12\", \"24-15-22\" ], \"Breite\": \"17,6 mm\", \"L\u00e4nge\": \"128,0 mm\", \"Nennstrom\": \"50,0 mA\", // further properties ... \"properties\": [ \"Breite\", \"L\u00e4nge\", \"Nennstrom\" // all properties are also listed here in this list by their name ] }, { \"_id\": \"shell-id-2\", \"classifications\": [ \"2-16\", \"24-12\", \"ABC\" ], \"Breite\": \"12,0 mm\", \"L\u00e4nge\": \"12,0 mm\", \"Einbautiefe\": \"138,3 mm\", // further properties ... \"properties\": [ \"Breite\", \"L\u00e4nge\", \"Einbautiefe\" ] }, // ... ... General querying guidelines You can use $search or $searchMeta pipeline operators. $search returns the source objects, while $searchMeta only returns the metadata like facet counts. You can use aggregation pipelines in your queries, simply provide an JSON array: [ // stage 1 { \"$search\":{ \"index\":\"...\" } }, // stage 2 { \"$project\":{ \"_id\":1 } }, // ... ] Example building a product search Let's say you want to build a classical product search, in which you want to show top used properties on the left side of the screen in a tree view, and the results on the right side. Most used properties First, you could run a query to find all most used property for a given classification: { \"$searchMeta\": { \"index\": \"search_shell_technical_classifications_de_index\", \"facet\": { \"operator\": { \"in\": { \"path\": \"classifications\", \"value\": \"24-11\" } }, \"facets\": { \"mostUsedProperties\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"properties\" } } } } } Count the hits per property Then, based on the results, you could calculate facets by including these N most used properties in a new query like this: { \"$searchMeta\": { \"index\": \"search_shell_technical_classifications_de_index\", \"facet\": { \"operator\": { \"in\": { \"path\": \"classifications\", \"value\": \"24-11\", }, }, \"facets\": { \"Breite\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"Breite\", }, \"L\u00e4nge\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"L\u00e4nge\", }, \"Nennstrom\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"Nennstrom\", }, }, }, } } To get the actual data and not only facets, you can run the same exact query with the $search operator. However, for performance reasons, you can actually fetch both the data and the metadata in a single query like this: [ { \"$search\": { \"index\": \"search_shell_technical_classifications_de_index\", \"facet\": { \"operator\": { \"in\": { \"path\": \"classifications\", \"value\": \"24-11\", }, }, \"facets\": { \"Breite\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"Breite\", }, \"L\u00e4nge\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"L\u00e4nge\", }, \"Nennstrom\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"Nennstrom\", }, }, }, }, }, { \"$facet\": { \"docs\": [ { \"$replaceRoot\": { \"newRoot\": \"$$ROOT\", }, }, ], \"meta\": [ { \"$replaceWith\": \"$$SEARCH_META\", }, { \"$limit\": 1, }, ], }, }, { \"$set\": { \"meta\": { \"$arrayElemAt\": [\"$meta\", 0], }, }, }, ] Please check the Mongo Atlas Search facet documentation \u29c9 for reference. Further subquerying If you allow the user to apply further criteria to search, such as a combination of AND and OR conditions on certain properties and values, then you can construct your queries using multiple nested compound operators. The query below uses should for OR conditions and nests them under a must operator to perform an AND condition. All hits where L\u00e4nge is either 101 mm or 105 mm and Breite is 50 mm are returned. // ... \"facet\": { \"operator\": { \"compound\": { \"filter\": { \"in\": { \"path\": \"classifications\", \"value\": \"24-11\", }, }, \"must\": [ { \"compound\": { \"should\": [ { \"equals\": { \"path\": \"L\u00e4nge\", \"value\": \"101 mm\", }, }, { \"equals\": { \"path\": \"L\u00e4nge\", \"value\": \"105 mm\", }, }, ], \"minimumShouldMatch\": 1, }, }, { \"compound\": { \"should\": [ { \"equals\": { \"path\": \"Breite\", \"value\": \"50 mm\", }, }, ], \"minimumShouldMatch\": 1, }, }, ], }, }, \"facets\": { // ... Pagination To get only certain amount of docs but all of the metadata, in-build search pagination feature can be used. Mongo search pagination is cursor-based, which means that every returned document has an unique position which you could use in your next query to request searching before or after this position. To extend on our last query from above, we could use pagination like this: [ { \"$search\": { \"index\": \"search_shell_technical_classifications_de_index\", // this is a token from a document retrieved in the previous query (can be the last document on the last page) \"searchAfter\": \"CABCVABCCAPw==\", \"facet\": { \"operator\": { \"in\": { \"path\": \"classifications\", \"value\": \"24-11\", }, }, \"facets\": { \"Breite\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"L\u00e4nge\", }, \"L\u00e4nge\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"L\u00e4nge\", }, \"Nennstrom\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"path\": \"Nennstrom\", }, }, }, }, }, { // for each of the returned documents we want to also include the cursor in a new field called paginationToken \"$addFields\": { \"paginationToken\" : { \"$meta\" : \"searchSequenceToken\" } } }, { // page of 20 documents \"$limit\": 20 }, { \"$facet\": { \"docs\": [ { \"$replaceRoot\": { \"newRoot\": \"$$ROOT\", }, }, ], \"meta\": [ { \"$replaceWith\": \"$$SEARCH_META\", }, { \"$limit\": 1, }, ], }, }, { \"$set\": { \"meta\": { \"$arrayElemAt\": [\"$meta\", 0], }, }, }, ] Formatting of values Values delivered by search are preformatted for the language requested. For example, \"de\" index would deliver 100.000,99 and \"en\" index would deliver \"100,000.99\". Formatting rules are based on the XSD data type declared on the valueType property (of the SubmodelElement). Our logic is implemented as follows: Values are formatted depending on the target culture numerical, datetime and other settings. We keep all the decimals, no rounding will be performed. We drop the trailing zeroes (e.g. 100.000,00 becomes 100.000) for all numerical types. Unit of measure from the concept descriptions is always added on the end of the value. Special cases Indexing We currently only support Property and MultiLanguageProperty submodel elements. For property names, concept descriptions data from the repository is used. Matching is done based on the semantic identifier of each of the properties. For values we use the value from the property itself and combine it with the unit from the concept description data. Multiple properties with the same property name are NOT supported. This situation could occur for several reasons: shell reference multiple technical data submodels with same properties two properties with different semantic identifiers have same text in a given language if same properties are found, only the first one will be used and the rest will not be indexed Querying When querying, it is important to note that the property names could contain special Mongo symbols such as . or $ . Most queries should work without problem since Mongo supports such property names, but some operators, like $project might not work correctly.","title":"Search"},{"location":"cloud-search/#search","text":"twinsphere search is a feature that allows you to use Mongo Atlas Search queries to search for shells based on their submodel data.

Remark Semantic submodels and the value-only serialization of the AAS standard are not the same - even if they look similar. The value-only format can not be converted back to its original form, our semantic submodels can! Semantic Submodels are described via XML schemas (which we call \"semantic submodel schemas\"). We derive these schemas from the structure and rules defined in the submodel templates.

These schemas are especially useful in workflow / mapping tools to create automatic connectors. API The API follows url-based versioning semantics, for example: /sphere/api/ v1.0 /semantic-connector Semantic connector is available under /sphere/api/{api-version}/semantic-connector . Take a look at the Swagger for more API documentation around each parameter and return value. Swagger for the semantic connector is available under /sphere/swagger/index.html . Semantic Schemas The derived schemas, which we call semantic schemas, are available under sphere/api/{api-version}/semantic-connector/schemas . Supported Submodel Templates With the first release of our Semantic Connector we offer (bi-directional) support for the following standard submodel templates: Digital Nameplate 2.0 Contact Information 1.0 Technical Data 1.2 Carbon Footprint 0.9 Handover Documentation 1.2 Hierarchical Structures enabling Bills of Material 1.1 We are already working on the support of any submodel templates stored in the twinsphere repository - be it published standard templates or user-defined templates.

The identifier is structured as follows: schema-engine-version/base64(submodel-template-semantic-id) For example: https://twinsphere.io/semantics/1/0/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZG1pbi1zaGVsbC5pby9aVkVJL1RlY2huaWNhbERhdGEvU3VibW9kZWwvMS8y the https://twinsphere.io/semantics/1/0 is the schema engine version (produced by twinsphere semantics in version 1.0) the base64 part ( aHR0c...ZWwvMS8y ) is the submodel template semantic id, decoded with value https://admin-shell.io/ZVEI/TechnicalData/Submodel/1/2 . therefore, this semantic schema is derived from submodel template Technical Data in version 1.2. Important The semantic schema uses the semantic ID of the submodel template, and not the ID field of the submodel template (these two are often the same, but in some cases they can differ). Semantic Instances Based on the semantic schemas, you can now read and write submodels in the \"semantic\" form using the semantic connector. To perform validation and serialization / deserialization correctly, you just need to always remember to reference the semantic schema via the xmlns attribute on the root element of the hierarchy, as in the example below: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?> <DigitalNameplate xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns=\"https://twinsphere.io/semantics/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZG1pbi1zaGVsbC5pby96dmVpL25hbWVwbGF0ZS8yLzAvTmFtZXBsYXRl\"> <Id>testsubmodel</Id> <UriOfTheProduct>https://www.domain-abc.com/Model-Nr-1234/Serial-Nr-5678</UriOfTheProduct> <ManufacturerName> <LanguageString> <Language>de</Language> <Value>Muster AG</Value> </LanguageString> </ManufacturerName> ... </DigitalNameplate>","title":"Semantic Connector"},{"location":"cloud-semantic-connector/#semantic-connector","text":"The twinsphere Semantic Connector enables a simplified generation of submodels.

Each object type has its own catalog. Its records are displayed as a list. On most items you may invoke actions, like viewing or editing a twin or displaying the detailed definitions of a concept description. If there are more entries than displayed (indicated by a \"+\" sign in the list header) a load more button is visible at the bottom of the list. Each load will add up to 50 entries. Every catalog has a refresh button which reloads the first 50 entries with the selected filters if any are available and set. Each id column contains a button that displays the shortened id. On click the full id is shown and can be copied to your clipboard. Version is only displayed if the version of the entry's administration is set, else there is just a \"-\" visible. If no revision is given it will be assumed as 0 . Catalog of Twins The catalog of twins has a toggle on top to switch between asset administration shells and submodels . Asset Administration Shells The quick filter at the top allows you to display only twins of the selected asset kind (types or instances). On the right a filter for the shells can be set: Filters are combined with a logical AND, so twins have to fulfill all set filter criteria to be in the result list. Text filters are case-insensitive. A partially qualified value can be specified for all attributes listed as regex supported filter properties . The submodel column shows the count of submodels the respective twin has. A click opens a dialog listing them with some basic information. The action represented by an eye symbol (or the \"Show\" button in the more menu) opens the twin in our twinsphere Viewer for viewing all of its data in detail. The action represented by a pen symbol (or the \"Edit\" button in the more menu) opens the twin in our Twin Builder for editing. The more menu offers two further features: The export of twins as JSON or XML to a file or directly to your system's clipboard. The duplication of instance twins (not types). The deletion of twins. Delete Twin Dialog After clicking on the deletion entry, a dialog appears. There you can see which twin will get deleted. You also have the possibility to deselect certain submodels of the twin, if you do not want them to be deleted. Submodels which are referenced by other twins, cannot be selected for deletion. If you want to delete a type twin, you will get a warning about its implications. Duplication of Instance Twins When duplicating an existing twin all of its data (shell and referenced submodels) are duplicated. New IDs are created and assigned to the copies. We highly recommend using the studio's ID Generator feature here. Otherwise, you'll be asked to enter an AAS-ID and GlobalAssetID manually and we will use the aas-id value appended by \"/sm/{ULID}\" automatically for all new submodel IDs. Submodels The Submodels view of the Twin Catalog lists all existing submodels of the connected tenant. The export of a submodel is available as action in the more menu of each record. Note The twin catalog of submodels is work in progress. There are more feature to come here. Catalog of Concept Descriptions This catalog lists all concept descriptions available in the corresponding repository of your twinsphere tenant. Since a concept description may consist of multiple data specifications the according catalog column shows which types of specification are included in each record. Currently only the type IEC61360 is recognized and displayed by name. Every other specification will be labeled as \"unknown\". Please give us a hint if you experience this value so we can improve our recognition here. If it is an IEC61360 data specification you can inspect the details of it by clicking on the eye button. The export of a concept description is available as action in the more menu of each record. Preferred Name , Short Name and Definition display an initial value from the available languages according to following criteria: the data language containing the data language the ui language containing the ui language english (en) containing english (en) You can select another language value by clicking on the corresponding language tag. Hovering over a tag will display an indicator above it. The selected language is highlighted with a gray background. Catalog of Submodel Templates This catalog displays all submodels in your twinsphere repository that are of kind template . These are the ones you can choose from when adding new submodel to your twin in Twin Builder . The export of a submodel template is available as action in the more menu of each record. Catalog of Drafts Your personal twin drafts are shown here. They are sorted by the last modified column in descending order. The state column shows if your draft has still issues (issue count as tooltip) or is valid already. You may continue editing the twin draft by clicking on the pen symbol or choosing \" Edit \" in the more menu. This is as well where you may \" Delete \" the draft or \" Export \" it. For valid drafts only the more menu offers a \" Publish \" action. This will publish the twin to the connect twinsphere tenant's repository and delete the draft afterward. Note With introduction of the upcoming twinstudio modules Template Designer and Blueprint Editor further draft types will become available and shown in this catalog as well. Catalog of Files This catalog lists all files of twinsphere's file repository . The classification value is displayed according to VDI 2770 Blatt 1: 2020, see respective table at Handover Documentation Submodel \u29c9 . Values that are not in this list will be displayed as invalid and empty values are represented by a dash ( - ). The file size is given in kilo bytes for values below 100 kB and in mega bytes if larger. The custom attributes column displays the amount of configured attributes. If greater than 0 it gets clickable. A popup dialog shows the keys and values of all custom attributes. An edit button enables you to directly edit them.

Generally the {ULID} token has to be used trying to ensure a unique ID. If the globalAssetId is active it is possible to use {ASSET-ULID} instead of {ULID} for the aasId and if you use this and generate a new twin the globalAssetId and the aasId will contain the same generated ulid . ID patterns have tenant scope The ID generator patterns are applied at the tenant level, not just to your user account. They are centrally stored in twinstudio. So other users will automatically create IDs according to the specified pattern when they are logged in to the relevant tenant. Language Settings twinstudio supports the following languages for its user interface: German English Furthermore you may set a preferred languages to represent the data content of your twins. All language settings have user scope and are stored locally in your browser. Tenant Switch twinstudio can connect to different twinsphere cloud tenants (access rights required). The tenants are hereby grouped into organizations. You can switch the tenant in the menu. twinstudio remembers (locally in the browser) the last tenant you logged in with and automatically uses this for your next session. Dashboard The dashboard of twinstudio serves as an entry point to the application. You can easily switch to the twin catalog or to any other module of the application. Via open digital twin from file you can upload a twin from a *.json, *.xml or *.aasx file. If the file contains multiple twins, you are presented a dialog to select the desired one. All submodels that are of type template will be filtered out and all contained files will be ignored. After the selection you will be redirected to the twinbuilder so you can start editing your twin. Object Naming The AAS metamodel offers various options for selecting a display name for its objects. All of these options are optional data fragments, i.e., it cannot be assumed that an object to be displayed actually has the desired information. Many of the options are also language-dependent, and it is uncertain whether data records are actually maintained for certain languages. For twinstudio \u2014 or any user interface in this sense \u2014 a certain hierarchy of fallbacks is required to determine the best option for naming the respective object. This is the only way to ensure, regardless of data quality, that a object name is available at all, which ideally enables the user to recognize what they are dealing with. In twinstudio the same object naming logic applies to the following AAS metamodel objects: shells concept descriptions submodels submodel elements The name of those objects is determined in the following order (first available value wins): Object's property displayName , language value in the following order: studio's language setting \"preferred data language\" studio's language setting \"UI language\" language \"EN\" list index (only if object is a list element of a submodel list) Object's property idShort Object's property id Object's Propropertyperty displayName , first existing value (can be of any language) \"Unknown Property\" / \"Unbekannte Eigenschaft\" Explanation: The displayName is the preferred value for each object. Since this is data from the twin, we first use the data language selected by the user. The user interface language comes second, as the user obviously understands this as well. The last resort is EN, which is neither the data language nor the user interface language of the user, but is nevertheless generally understood. A submodel list item must not have an idShort (specification v3.0) and, as an SME, it also has no id . Therefore, we use its list index as the name if no displayName is available. For all other objects, an idShort is recommended, although this is not mandatory. Even though it is a technical property, its value is in English in most cases and has semantic meaning. Therefore, we also consider it as a name. Shells, submodels, and concept descriptions must have an id , so we use this as the last resort for these objects. However, this does not apply to SMEs, as they do not have an id . The last option for SMEs is therefore any other existing displayName value other than those mentioned above. If none of these work, we use a constant for naming SMEs as a last resort. Note Concept Description are not yet used by twinstudio for the time being. It is planned tough to take them into consideration for determination of an object's display name as well (e.g. preferredName of the data specification). Drafts twinstudio is able to save your unfinished work as a so called draft . These drafts belong exclusively to the user who saved them. They cannot be accessed by anyone else. Drafts are stored in twinstudio and not in your twinsphere tenant/repository. Therefore, they may not yet be fully valid and may still contain validation errors.

It allows users to conveniently fill in and change the values of all elements, while increasing accessibility by hiding the complex details of the meta model as much as possible. Twin Creation Wizard The Creation Wizard helps you to create a digital twin. You can open the Creation Wizard by clicking on the Create New Digital Twin buttons in the catalog or on the dashboard. The Creation Wizard offers two options for creating a digital twin. Step 1 - Basis Selection Note We plan to include more options for creating twins here, like deriving an instance from a type twin or using a blueprint as basis. For now you can choose \"from scratch\" or \"duplicate an existing instance\" Stay tuned :) Option 1 - New Digital Twin from Scratch If you create a digital twin from scratch you can choose the asset kind in the right radio button list. If you are unsure which asset kind is appropriate for your situation ( Instance/Type/Undefined ), the help texts describing the options may be of assistance. Option 2 - Duplicate Existing Instance If you duplicate an existing instance you can search for an instance, which you want to duplicate. Your entered search term will be matched via a regular expression against following attributes: displayName globalAssetId idShort AAS Id If there are more than 10 matches, you have to redefine the search, to narrow down the match count. When you select a result, it will be automatically expanded, and you can see where the instance matched the search term. If you select this option, the wizard will only guide you to step 2 below. No further information is required; it will be taken from the original copy. Step 2 - Add IDs and Basic Information In the second step you have to set an id for the digital twin, add a display name and refer to your physical asset by adding an asset identifier. The id for the digital twin has to be unique. The asset identifier could be common because you could create many digital twins for one physical asset. The display name is required because it is used to determine the name of the shell in the catalog. Depending on your usage of the ID Generator feature twinstudio may already have filled-in some of the inputs above automatically for you. Step 3 - Add Description (Optional) This step in the creation of a digital twin is optional. You may add a textual description for the new digital twin here. This might help you and other users later on to understand the content or purpose of this twin. Please only use English language here. You may add more/other languages later in the editor. Step 4 - Adding Submodels (Optional) In the last step of the digital twin creation you can add the submodels you need. The submodels you can choose from are submodel templates, which are stored in your twinsphere cloud . If you click the Create Digital Twin button every selected submodel template will be transformed into a submodel instance, given a unique ID and added to your digital twin. We highly recommend using the studio's ID Generator feature here. Otherwise, will use the aas-id value appended by \"/sm/{ULID}\" automatically for all new submodel IDs to be created. Edit Shell Properties If you want to edit properties ( asset kind, global asset id and specific asset ids ) of your shell the editing has to be unlocked. Via the dropdown you can add specific asset ids, if the editing has been enabled. The asset type of the shell is shown in the row below these properties. If the URL points to an existing twin in your current tenant, a link to it will be displayed. Add/Remove Submodels The Submodels of your currently opened twin can be edited via the edit submodel button in the top right corner. The current submodels of your twin are at the top of the list. The rest of the list contains all available submodel templates from your current tenant. To select the same template multiple times you have to add them one at a time. If a new submodel template is added it will be converted to a submodel of type instance and its elements are modified to reflect this change. Add/Remove Submodel Elements In the navigation list a symbol is displayed in every submodel entry. This states if the template for your submodel has been found in your tenant. If this is the case you can find the add element button on some of the submodel elements. There are an add to navigation and add to page section. Adding a navigation element will insert a child in the navigation tree. To delete this element you have to visit the node. Adding an element to the page will cluster similar elements. Next to them there will be a trashcan to delete each entry. Some templates specify cardinality of one or onetomany then the last element cannot be removed. Arbitrary Properties Some templates specify arbitrary properties. At the moment twinstudio only supports editing the first. Twinstudio cannot assume in good faith the correct idShort for additional elements. In the add dialog these entries are grayed out and display the info. Fill-In Submodel Element Values Properties Property elements have a valueType according to which the different selection elements will be displayed. The types of time, date, and datetime have a custom representation, all others are shown in a default input field. Default The value of a property is represented by an input field. Please make sure that the datatype of the property matches the value you set into the input field. The Validation Issue List will have an issue if the datatype of the value does not match the datatype of the property. The input field expands up to 5 rows and a scrollbar will be displayed for longer content. Date The selected value will be displayed in local date (according to browser locale, in the image the locale was set to de ). In the calendar popup you can navigate between months with the arrow buttons. By clicking the month-year the year selection will be shown and after selecting a year you will be returned to the initial calendar. The clear button will set the value to null . Time The selected value will be displayed in local time (according to browser locale, in the image the locale was set to de ). In the time popup you can select hours, minutes and seconds. AM PM selection will only be shown if your locale suggests it. The columns are scrollable to reach desired values. By clicking the month-year the year selection will be shown and after selecting a year you will be returned to the initial calendar. The clear button will set the value to null . Date-Time The selected value will be displayed in local date time (according to browser locale, in the image the locale was set to de ). In the dropdown there is a combination of the calendar and the time selection. By clicking the month-year the year selection will be shown and after selecting a year you will be returned to the initial calendar. The clear button will set the value to null . Multi Language Properties The Multi Language Properties displays all languages for which a value is set, with tags above the value. The initially displayed value in the field is determined as follows using the languages of an entry and match it with (ISO 639-1): the data language containing the data language the ui language containing the ui language english (en) containing english (en) You can select another language value by clicking on the corresponding language tag. Hovering over a tag will display an indicator above it. The selected language is highlighted with a gray background. The dialog box that opens when you click on the pencil icon shows all the values that have been set for the Multi Language Property. You can add new values and delete existing ones. Make sure that at least one value is set. The value input fields expands up to 5 rows and a scrollbar will be displayed for longer content. At the top, you can see which value will be displayed when you click Save . If you click on the info icon, you will see an explanation of why this value was selected. File Elements You can fill in the file elements by clicking on the Add File button. In the dialog box, you can now choose whether you want to upload a file or store an external file. If you upload a file, it will be stored in the twinsphere file storage and a reference will be written to the element. If you store an external file, the link will be stored as a value. If no content type is specified in the template, the content type is set to octet-stream. File links that would overflow the input will be clipped. Range The Range can set minimum and maximum as values. If it is required, either a minimum or maximum value has to be set to satisfy the validation. If the data type describes a number (according to xsd schema \u29c9 ), it is validated whether the minimum is smaller than the maximum. Reference Elements To set the value of a reference element, click the Add Reference button and then select an asset administration shell. You can then refer to a submodel or submodel element and save the reference. The reference is displayed as shown below. Current limitations Reference Elements only support referencing submodels and submodel elements within the same twin. This behavior will be changed in future releases. Entity This element is displayed in the tree on the left. On the page you can select to set a reference to an existing twin. If selected an input field is shown in which the globalAssetId of a twin has to be entered. When the twin exists in the twinsphere a link to the AAS-Viewer is activated. The button with the magnifying glass icon opens a dialog in which it is possible to search for a twin. Only 10 results will be shown. Twins without a globalAssetId will be disabled for selection. Validation Issue List After each value change your twin gets validated. The count of issues will be displayed atop of the list. The errors are grouped by their path which can be displayed with the show issue path toggle. Clicking on an issue will navigat you to the element and the edit mode will be opened. Save Draft To save a draft, simply click on the Save Draft button. Once saved, a toast message will appear in the upper left corner. Drafts are only visible to you and can only be edited or deleted by you. You can view all your drafts in the draft catalog . Publish to Repo To publish a digital twin, all errors in the error list must be corrected. Once all errors have been corrected, the twin can be published by clicking the \"Publish\" button. Once the twin has been successfully published, a dialog box displays the ID, name, and tenant to which the twin was uploaded. Once the twin has been published, the corresponding draft is deleted from the draft catalog.

Save State The save state display shows you the current state of the draft or twin you are working on. There are three save states for a twin: Unsaved Changes Draft Saved Published Unsaved Changes The Unsaved changes status indicates that changes have been made to the twin or draft that have not yet been saved. These can be saved by publishing or saving . Draft Saved The Draft Saved status indicates that the draft has been saved as a draft. Published The Published status indicates that the draft/twin has been published in your repository or has been loaded from the repository in this state.

The tools that support it are also still in development and, in some cases, do not yet have support for the latest specification. The creators of AAS are under immense pressure in this situation. They must adapt their data using incomplete tools to a standard that is both difficult to access and constantly changing. Not surprisingly, data quality problems emerge. At conplement AG, we are proud to provide twinsphere, a software suite for the creation, hosting, and distribution of asset administration shells. As its provider, we often encounter data quality issues when customers try to upload their AAS to our platform. The purpose of this guide is to explain the meaning and reason behind validation errors in terms of the AAS specification and to provide support for handling them. It focuses on the most commonly encountered validation errors on our end, but it is not exhaustive. Additional errors may be added in the future. We hope this guide will assist you on your Asset Administration Shell journey!

If you try to upload an asset administration shell of an earlier version the platform will deny it. Specification Reference Product Description twinsphere \u29c9 Part 1 v3.0 \u29c9 Recommended Solution The Eclipse AASX Package Explorer is able to convert v2 packages into the v3 format. Try to upgrade your package with the current Eclipse AASX Package Explorer \u29c9 Open the Asset Administration Shell with the AasxPackageExplorer Save the Asset Administration Shell as a new Asset Administration Shell Re-Upload the converted AASX package to twinsphere Common Attributes idShort idShort has to be unique within the same namespace Error Message Constraint AASd-022: ID-short of non-identifiable referables within the same name space shall be unique (case-sensitive). Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.2.10 Referable Attributes, P. 56 \u29c9 Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.12.2 Constraints for Referables and Identifiables, Constraint AASd-022, P. 105 \u29c9 Remarks idShort is case-sensitive. A name space is defined as the parent element(s), which an element is part of and that is either referable or identifiable. Constraint is necessary in order to address an element via API by an unique idShortPath . Recommended Solution Change idShort to a unique value or number identical values from 01 to n (i.e. DigitalFile -> DigitalFile01). idShort of Referables shall only feature letters, digits, underscore Error Message ID-Short of Referables shall only feature letters, digits, underscore ( _ ); starting mandatory with a letter, i.e. [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.2.10 Referable Attributes, Constraint AASd-002, P.57 Remarks Hyphen is NOT allowed as of v3.0.1 of the specification. Hyphen will be allowed with upcoming version v3.1 of the specification, see Issue #295 of aas-specs-metamodel in Github for details. Recommended Solution Replace separators like hyphens, dots or commas in the idShort with an underscore. Asset Information Asset Identifier At least one Asset Identifier has to be defined Error Message Constraint AASd-131: Either the global asset ID shall be defined or at least one specific asset ID. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.4 Asset Information Attributes, Constraint AASd-131, P. 60 ) Remarks Since globalAssetId and (the value of) specificAssetId are both identifiers they have to be GLOBALLY unique. Recommended Solution Define one globalAssetId or add at least a specificAssetId to the asset information. Submodel SubmodelIdss Do not use SemanticId as SubmodelId of Submodel Problem Description Submodels require to have globally unique ids to be identifiable in any given scenario. Sometimes we encounter the semanticId of the submodel template being used as SubmodelId for a concrete submodel instance. This is not valid since the semanticId does not identify a single submodel instance and therefore is not a valid identifier. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.5 Submodel Attributes, P. 62 Remarks Submodels are Identifiables and therefore must have globally unique ids. Recommended Solution You should use URNs (e.g. urn:GMA:7.20:contractnegotiation:1:1#001) or URIs (e.g. http://www.vdi.de/gma720/ \u29c9 contractnegotiation/1/1#001) to create such a (submodel) identifier. See Part 1, Annex A, How Are New Identifiers Created? and Best Practice for Creating URI Identifiers , P. 124 for more information. Submodel Elements Data Element Valid values for Data Element Category Error Message Constraint AASd-090: For data elements category shall be one of the following values: CONSTANT, PARAMETER or VARIABLE.: {position} Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.7.6 Data Element and Overview of Data Element Types, Constraint AASd-090, P. 69 Remarks Default value is VARIABLE. Categories are deprecated and should no longer be used. Recommended Solution Remove the category attribute from the data element. File Wrong URI Scheme for referenced files Error Message The value must represent a valid file URI scheme according to RFC 8089. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11.2 Primitive Data Types, Primitive \"PathType\", P. 97 RFC 8089 - The \"file\" URI Scheme \u29c9 Remarks All submodel elements \"file\" have to use the PathType which demand a URI according to RFC 8089. This also applies to the path of defaultThumbnail within AssetInformation . RFC 8089 or \"The 'file' URI Scheme\" demands a leading file-scheme for an URI, so it has to start with \"file:\". AASX Package Explorer (v2023-11-17 and earlier) is not able to handle PathTypes with correctly referenced files (file:/...) and will not be shown them. The specification currently is not consistent since the examples for PathType given in Part 1 v3.0 are not all valid (./Specification.pdf). The upcoming specification Part 1 v3.1 will address this issue by allowing more generic URIs. See Issue #299 of aas-specs-metamodel on Github for details. Recommended Solution For now: Change the file path from /aasx/files/example.pdf to file:/aasx/files/example.pdf. Empty File Path Error Message Filepath can not be null Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11.2 Primitive Data Types, Primitive \"PathType\", P. 97 \u29c9 Remarks Since the PathType of a file value is an identifier, it must contain a valid reference identifying something. Same applies to the path attribute on a defaultThumbnail in AssetInformation . Recommended Solution Add a valid and existing file path to the file property or remove the property. Valid Content Type of File Error Message The value must represent a valid content MIME type according to RFC 2046. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.7.9 File Attributes, P. 71 Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11.2 Primitive Data Types, Primitive \"ContentType\", P. 96 Remarks Valid MIME types for the contentType attribute are defined in RFC 2046 \u29c9 . Recommended Solution Assign a MIME type to the file that is RFC 2046 compliant. Property Value must be consistent with the value type of the property Error Message Value must be consistent with the value type. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11 Primitive and Simple Data Types, P. 95 Remarks Part 1's chapter on primitive and simple data types helps to determine the data type of the respective property. Recommended Solution Apply values with the right data type to the property. MultiLanguageProperty Value specifies duplicate languages Error Message Value specifies no duplicate languages. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.7.10 Multi Language Property Attributes, P. 72 Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11.2 Primitive Data Types, Primitive \"MultiLanguageTextType\", P. 97 Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11.2 Primitive Data Types, Primitive \"LangStringSet\", P. 96 Remarks The value of the MultiLanguageProperty depends on the serialization and has a similar structure like a dictionary. So the indices in the multi language value have to be unique. The error message is currently somewhat misleading. A corresponding aas-core-works issue has already been created. Recommended Solution Check that the langStrings do not have overlapping languages. Remove entries with duplicate keys so each language has exactly one entry. Valid language tags Error Message The value must represent a value language tag conformant to BCP 47. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.11.3 Enumeration for Submodel Element Value Types, Enumeration \"DataTypeDefRdf\", P. 103f \u29c9 Remarks RDF requires IETF BCP 4729 language tags \u29c9 . Simple two-letter language tags for locales like \"de\" conformant to ISO 639-1 are allowed, as well as language tags plus extension like \"de-DE\" for country code, dialect, etc. like in \"en-US\" for English (United States) or \"en-GB\" for English (United Kingdom). Recommended Solution Make sure that all uses language tags in the MultiLanguageProperty value are valid as described above. References Empty Keys Error Message Keys must contain at least one item. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.10.2 Reference Attributes, P. 81 Remarks Cardinality of attribute 'key' is 1..*. Recommended Solution Add at least one key to the reference or remove the whole reference. Submodels References All submodel references must be model references to a submodel Error Message All submodels must be model references to a submodel. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.3 Asset Administration Shell Attributes, P. 59 Recommended Solution Make sure that the type of every submodel reference is set to ModelReference . Make sure that the type of every key of the submodel reference is set to Submodel . Valid types of first reference key Error Message Constraint AASd-121: For References the value of type of the first key of keys shall be one of Globally Identifiables Specification Reference Part 1, 5.3.10.4 Constraints, Constraint AASd-121, P. 93 Part 1, 5.3.10.3 Key Attributes, Enumeration \"GloballyIdentifiables\", P. 88 Remarks For References , the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of GloballyIdentifiables . Part 1 v3.0.1 specifies the following literals in the enumeration GloballyIdentifiables : \"AssetAdministrationShell\", \"ConceptDescription\", \"GlobalReference\", \"Identifiable\" and \"Submodel\". Be aware that more restrictive constraints exist for other, more specific reference types , i.e. external or model references. Recommended Solution Make sure the type value of the first key of your reference is one of the afore mentioned literals. Type of first external reference key has to be 'GlobalReference' Error Message Constraint AASd-122: For external references the value of type of the first key of keys shall be one of Generic Globally Identifiables. Specification Reference Part 1, 5.3.10.4 Constraints, Constraint AASd-122, P. 93 Part 1, 5.3.10.3 Key Attributes, Enumeration \"GenericGloballyIdentifiables\", P. 93 Remarks For external references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ExternalReference , the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of GenericGloballyIdentifiables . Part 1 v3.0.1 defines exactly one literal in the enumeration GenericGloballyIdentifiables which is \"GlobalReference\". Recommended Solution Make sure the first key of your external reference is of type GlobalReference . Valid types of first model reference key Error Message Constraint AASd-123: For model references the value of type of the first key of keys shall be one of AAS identifiables. Specification Reference Part 1, 5.3.10.4 Constraints, Constraint AASd-123, P. 93 Part 1, 5.3.10.3 Key Attributes, Enumeration \"AasIdentifiables\", P. 92 Remarks For model references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ModelReference , the value of Key/type of the first key of Reference/keys shall be one of AasIdentifiables . Part 1 v3.0.1 specifies the following literals in the enumeration AasIdentifiables : \"AssetAdministrationShell\", \"ConceptDescription\", \"Identifiable\" and \"Submodel\". Recommended Solution Make sure the type value of the first key of your model reference is one of the afore mentioned literals. Valid types of last external reference key Error Message Constraint AASd-124: For external references the last key of keys shall be either one of Generic Globally Identifiables or one of Generic Fragment Keys. Specification Reference Part 1, 5.3.10.4 Constraints, Constraint AASd-124, P. 93 Part 1, 5.3.10.3 Key Attributes, Enumeration \"GenericFragmentKeys\", P. 92 Remarks For external references, i.e. References with Reference/type = ExternalReference , the last key of Reference/keys shall be either one of GenericGloballyIdentifiables or one of GenericFragmentKeys . Part 1 v3.0.1 defines exactly one literal in the enumeration GenericGloballyIdentifiables which is \"GlobalReference\". Part 1 v3.0.1 defines exactly one literal in the enumeration GenericFragmentKeys which is \"FragmentReference\". Recommended Solution Make sure the type value of the last key of your external reference is one of the mentioned two literals. Errors with Specific Submodels Handover Documentation General Errors No Cardinality Counters in ECLASS IRDI Path of SemanticIds Problem Description The semanticId of a Submodel Elements like DocumentId , DocumentClassification or DocumentVersion has a defined ECLASS IRDI path. This is a fixed exact value in each case, e.g. \"0173-1#02-ABI501#001/0173-1#01- AHF580#001\", \" 0173-1#02-ABI502#001/0173-1#01-AHF581#001\" or \"0173-1#02-ABI503#001/0173-1#01-AHF582#001\". Sometimes we encounter a semanticId for those elements with an additional attached string like \"0173-1#02-ABI501#001/0173-1#01-AHF580#001*01\", \"0173-1#02-ABI502#001/0173-1#01-AHF581#001*01\" or \"0173-1#02-ABI503#001/0173-1#01-AHF582#001*01\". These are no valid semanticId as specified in the Handover Documentation submodel template. Specification Reference Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.6 SubmodelElements of DocumentID, P. 16 Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.7 SubmodelElements of DocumentClassification, P. 17 Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.8 SubmodelElements of DocumentVersion, P. 19 Remarks According to ECLASS's IRDI Path definition \u29c9 the star character (*) is a separator between reference property and cardinality counter. Recommended Solution Do not use cardinality counters in semanticIds . Make sure the semanticId of each Submodel Element has the exact value as defined in the submodel template specification. Errors with SubmodelElements of Document SemanticId of SubmodelElement Document Problem Description The semanticId of a Document should be 0173-1#02-ABI500#001/0173-1#01-AHF579#001. Sometimes it is mistaken with the ECLASS IRDI for number of DocumentIds 0173-1#02-ABH990#001. Specification Reference Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.4 Attributes of the Submodel instance, idShort \"Document{00}\", P. 13 Remarks 0173-1#02-ABI500#001 (property) is defined as \"This SubmodelElementCollection holds the information for a document entity\" 0173-1#01-AHF579#001 (class) is defined as \"Each SubmodelElementCollection describes a document by standard, which is associated to the particular Asset Administration Shell\" 0173-1#02-ABH990#001 (property) is defined as \"Number of documents (handover documentation)\" Recommended Solution Make sure the semanticId of the Document Submodel Element Collection has the value \"0173-1#02-ABI500#001/0173-1#01-AHF579#001\". Errors with SubmodelElements of DocumentID Mandatory property ValueId in Submodel Element DocumentId Problem Description ValueId is a required value in the DocumentId . Sometimes we encounter handover documentation submodel instances where ValueId is missing in some or all DocumentIds . Specification Reference Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.6 SubmodelElements of DocumentID, shortId \"ValueId\", P. 16 Remarks ValueId is an identification number of the Document within a given domain, e.g. the providing organization Example values for ValueId : 1213455566, XF90-884 Recommended Solution Make sure there is a value set for each ValueId of each DocumentId representing an identifier which clearly identifies the document within your organization. Errors with SubmodelElements of DocumentVersion SemanticId of SubmodelElement DigitalFile Problem Description The semanticId of a digital file should be 0173-1#02-ABI504#001/0173-1#01-AHF583#001. Sometimes it is mistaken with the ECLASS IRDI for the document path 0173-1#02-ABI005#001, which doesn't describe the whole file. Specification Reference Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.8 SubmodelElements of DocumentVersion, idShort \"DigitalFile{00}\", P. 21 Remarks 0173-1#02-ABI504#001 (property) is defined as \"MIME-Type, file name and file contents given by the file SubmodelElement\". 0173-1#01-AHF583#001 (class) is defined as \"MIME-Type, file name and file contents given by the file SubmodelElement\". 0173-1#02-ABI005#001 (property) is defined as \"Path of the document\". Recommended Solution Replace the semanticId of the DigitalFile element with the IRDI path \"0173-1#02-ABI504#001/0173-1#01-AHF583#001\". IdShort of SubmodelElement DigitalFile Problem Description IdShorts for digital files have to be unique within the DocumentVersion. It is recommended to name them \"DigitalFile\" with a following two-digit number. Specification Reference Handover Documentation v1.2, 2.8 SubmodelElements of DocumentVersion, idShort \"DigitalFile{00}\", P. 21 Handover Documentation v1.2, Annex A. Explanations of table formats used, 2. Tables on Submodels and SubmodelElements, P. 23 Remarks IdShorts for digital files have to be unique within the DocumentVersion. It is recommended to name them \"DigitalFile\" with a following two-digit number: DigitalFile{00}. If an idShort ends with \u2018{00}\u2019, this indicates a suffix of the respective length (here: 2) of decimal digits to make the idShort unique. A different idShort might be chosen, as long as it is unique in the parent\u2019s context. Recommended Solution Name the idShort of digital files of one document version \"DigitalFile\" and add a number from 01 to XX. Example: DigitalFile01, DigitalFile02, ... Errors related to Exchange Data Formats XML Serialization Relevant if you use XML in the aas-spec file of your AASX package, e.g. by using the AASX Package Explorer to generate packages. Empty XML Nodes Main error source here is that the official XML schema is demanding that most XML nodes need to contain something (item/value) or be non-existent. So, in many cases empty XML nodes are not allowed by the schema. Empty EmbeddedDataSpecification Error Message Embedded data specifications must be either not set or have at least one item.: {position} Specification Reference Issue #296 of admin-shell-io/aas-specs on Github \u29c9 Part 1 v3.0, 7.2.5 Embedded Data Specifications, Figure 58 Realization of Embedded Data Specifications, P. 115 Part 1 v3.0, Annex D. Templates for UML Tables, Template for Classes, Note 3, P. 135 XML-Schema v3.0.7, , line 278 ff. Remarks EmbeddedDataSpecifications must contain both, a DataSpecification and a DataSpecificationContent node. Cardinality is wrongly documented in Part 1 v3.0, see linked issue. Recommended Solution Remove the empty node from the XML file or add DataSpecificationContent to it. Empty SubmodelElementCollection/Value Error Message Value must be either not set or have at least one item. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.7.16 Submodel Element Collection Attributes, P. 76 Part 1 v3.0, Annex D. Templates for UML Tables, Template for Classes, Note 3, P. 135 XML-Schema v3.0.7, , line 869 ff. Remarks The attribute value of a SubmodelElementCollection is optional. But if there is a value it must contain at least one SubmodelElement item to it. Recommended Solution Remove the empty SubmodelElementCollection node from the XML file or add at least one SubmodelElement to it. Empty SubmodelElement/Description Error Message Description must be either not set or have at least one item. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.2.10 Referable Attributes, P. 56 Part 1 v3.0, Annex D. Templates for UML Tables, Template for Classes, Note 3, P. 135 XML-Schema v3.0.7, , line 739 ff. Remarks The attribute description of any Referable is optional. Among others all SubmodelElements (like Properties) are Referables . If the description attribute is set it must contain at least one item. Recommended Solution Remove the empty description node from the XML file or add at least one item to it. Empty Entity/Statements Error Message Statements must be either not set or have at least one item. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.7.7 Entity Attributes, P. 70 Part 1 v3.0, Annex D. Templates for UML Tables, Template for Classes, Note 3, P. 135 XML-Schema v3.0.7, , line 293 ff. Remarks The attribute statements of an entity is optional. If the statements attribute is set it must contain at least one statement. Recommended Solution Remove the empty statements node from submodel in the XML file or add at least one statement item to it. Empty Qualifiers Error Message Qualifiers must be either not set or have at least one item. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, 5.3.2.8 Qualifiable Attributes, P. 53 XML-Schema v3.0.7, , line 659 ff. Remarks \"A qualifiable element may be further qualified by one or more qualifiers. \" The XML element qualifiers of a submodel element is optional. If the qualifiers element is present it must contain at least one qualifier element. Recommended Solution Remove the empty qualifiers node from the submodel in the XML file or add at least one qualifier element to it. Empty (Language) Strings Error Message The value must not be empty. Specification Reference Part 1 v3.0, Annex D. Templates for UML Tables, Template for Classes, Note 2, P. 135 XML-Schema v3.0.7, , line 659 ff. Remarks Please note that the above schema reference is just one example among many. ALL occurrences of \"xs:string\" in the XML schema are provided with a restriction of minLength=1. Recommended Solution Add a content of at least 1 character length to the attribute or remove it completely from the XML file. Package File Format (AASX) The AASX package file format is based on the Open Packaging Conventions and specified in Specification of the Asset Administration Shell, Part 5: Package File Format (AASX) . Relationships Relationships are used within an AASX package to connect the package to files, and to connect various files in the package. They form the logical model of the package. No origin part found for aasx-origin Error Message No origin part found Specification Reference Part 5 v3.0.1, 5.2 Conventions for the Asset Administration Shell Package File Format (AASX), P. 16 Remarks 'aasx-origin' is the entry point when processing an AASX package. It is defined in the relationship file /_rels/.rels within the package and has to be of relationship type ' http://admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships/aasx-origin \u29c9 '. It has been ' http://www.admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships \u29c9 ' in advance to v3, but this type with 'www.' is now deprecated and will lead to the stated error for v3 packages. See also Fix URIs for V3 by mristin \u00b7 Pull Request #40 \u00b7 aas-core-works/aas-package3-csharp . Be aware that the AASX Package Explorer didn't handle the relationship type for v3 packages correctly for some time. This issue should fixed by now, see v2024-03-05.alpha release reintroduces bug that was fixed in v2024-02-27.alpha \u00b7 Issue #184 \u00b7 eclipse-aaspe/package-explorer (github.com) . Recommended Solution Make sure that the relationship type for the aasx-origin in the /_rels/.rels file is ' http://admin-shell.io/aasx/relationships/aasx-origin \u29c9 ' (without 'www.'). Make sure that the target property is filled with the correct relative path. Supplemental Files (aas-suppl) Incorrect File Path Error Message Document with value {filepath} could not be found in the aasx package Specification Reference Part 5 v3.0, 5.3 ECMA-376 Relationships, Relationship Type \"aas-suppl\", P. 20 Remarks When a relative URI is used to reference a file from within the data of an AAS this file has to be part of the AASX package (must exists). Recommended Solution Make sure all referenced files exist in the package and the folder and file names are correct. Make sure that all relatively referenced files are listed as aas-suppl targets in the relationship part file (e.g. /aasx/_rels/data.json.rels) of the aasx package. Check if unused references exist in the relationship file.

The tools that support it are also still in development and, in some cases, do not yet have support for the latest specification. The creators of AAS are under immense pressure in this situation. They must adapt their data using incomplete tools to a standard that is both difficult to access and constantly changing. Not surprisingly, data quality problems emerge. At conplement AG, we are proud to provide twinsphere, a software suite for the creation, hosting, and distribution of asset administration shells. As its provider, we often encounter data quality issues when customers try to upload their AAS to our platform. The purpose of this guide is to explain the meaning and reason behind validation errors in terms of the AAS specification and to provide support for handling them. It focuses on the most commonly encountered validation errors on our end, but it is not exhaustive. Additional errors may be added in the future.

Convenience for developers to reduce the necessary study of the AAS meta model specifications. For example, XML code documentation is heavily used to describe AAS semantics in the library. Definition of meta models for selected submodels, such as Digital Nameplate. Offering packaging functionality based on the.aasx format. In its design, the library is designed to make the creation of shells and submodels as easy, as possible, while reducing sources of potential errors where possible. To this end, it employs some basic design rules: Use distinct types where possible: Submodels are class citizens: where possible (i.e., where submodel templates are not ambiguous), submodels and their submodel elements are modelled, individual types. Enums to encode restricted properties. Prevent illegal states where possible, both, with respect to the meta model specification, as well as, to the submodel template specification: At compile time via signatures: creation methods enforce mandatory arguments, preventing incomplete submodel elements. At runtime time via fail-fast principle: constraints enforce correct types and qualifiers, e.g., the number of elements in lists. At runtime in conversion: meta models are validated in conversion. Validation errors cause the conversion to fail early. Hide metadata from the user: any SMT metadata, such as SemanticIds, IdShorts, ValueTypes, ... is handled internally. Users don't have to worry about them. Working with Shells and Packages Shell Abstractions The twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels library provides all means for the creation, processing, and modification of AAS shells. Depending on your use case, you can either create a new shell, either by constructor call, or using the provided builder pattern: using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Shell; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Shell.Builder; // via constructor var shell = new AssetAdministrationShell(\"9A8F8B66-5AA7-4528-AA17-1CC128AF64C2\", new AssetInformation( Core.AssetKind.Instance, globalAssetId: \"urn:conplement:aas:type:7689239_f0b4f6ff-6951-4614-b733-6da43db7af9a\", defaultThumbnail: new PackageFile(\"/some/local/path/conplement-product-thumbnail.png\", \"image/png\") ), description: new MultiLanguageString([{\"en-EN\", \"description\"}, {\"de-DE\", \"Beschreibung\"}])); // equivalent, via builder var shell = new AssetAdministrationShellBuilder(\"9A8F8B66-5AA7-4528-AA17-1CC128AF64C2\", new AssetInformation( Core.AssetKind.Instance, globalAssetId: \"urn:conplement:aas:type:7689239_f0b4f6ff-6951-4614-b733-6da43db7af9a\", defaultThumbnail: new PackageFile(\"/some/local/path/conplement-product-thumbnail.png\", \"image/png\") )) .WithDescription(new MultiLanguageString([{\"en-EN\", \"description\"}, {\"de-DE\", \"Beschreibung\"}])) .Build(); Additionally, there is also the ability to load from and convert to shells of the AasCore types: using AasCore.Aas3_0; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Shell; Aas3_0.IShell metamodelShell; // load, e.g. from a repository // convert to the TypedAasMetamodels representation AssetAdministrationShell shell; try { shell = AssetAdministrationShell.FromMetamodel(metamodelShell); } catch (ValidationException exception) { Console.Error($\"Could not load erroneous shell: {exception}\"); } // modify the shell // convert it back try { metamodelShell = shell.ToMetamodel(); } catch (ValidationException exception) { Console.Error($\"Could not convert to metamodel: {exception}\"); } Note In general the shell abstractions act as a thin layer around the types of the types of AasCore. They primarily extend them with convenience methods and stricter correctness checks to prevent user errors as early as possible. Packaging Creating .aasx packages from scratch typically is complex and involves a number of tedious steps: Create submodels Create shells Reference the submodels in the shell Collect any used concept descriptions and reference them in the shell Collect files for packaging Collect the thumbnail file of the shell While you can do these steps manually, for most cases it should suffice to use the AasxPackageBuilder , that automatically takes care of the above steps: using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Submodels.DigitalNameplate.V2_0; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Shell; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Shell.Builder; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Packaging; // 1. create the shell AssetAdministrationShell shell; // 2. create some submodels DigitalNameplate nameplate; // 3.1. include an external file reference nameplate.CompanyLogo = new FileReference(\"https://some.tld/some/image.png\"); // 3.2. alternatively, include a reference to a local file nameplate.CompanyLogo = new PackageFileReference(\"/home/user/some/image.png\"); // 4. we can now create an.aasx package out of all of this // Note: packagingInfo will wrap all information necessary for packaging, i.e., submodels, // referenced concept descriptions, and files to include into the paths, if available. var packagingInfo = PackagePreprocessor.ProcessShell(shell, [digitalNameplate]); var aasxPackage = new AasxPackageBuilder(packagingInfo).Build(); Note Take care to use the PackageFileReference type if you want to include local files into your package. This type wraps a reference to a file on disk. In the packaging step PackageFileReference elements will be included into the package and their links will resolved accordingly. See Submodel Elements for more details on the built-in types of the library. Working with Submodels Supported Submodels We are constantly working on the support of additional submodels. At the time of writing, twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels provides support for the following submodels: IDTA 02023 Carbon Footprint 0.9 IDTA 02002-1-0 Submodel for Contact Information 1.0 IDTA 02006-2-0 Digital Nameplate for industrial equipment 2.0 IDTA 02004-1-2 Handover Documentation 1.2 IDTA 02011-1-1 Hierarchical Structures enabling Bills of Material 1.1 IDTA 02003-1-2 Generic Frame for Technical Data for Industrial Equipment in Manufacturing 1.2 Types of the Meta Model In twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels we aim to provide an easy to use API for the work with submodels. To this end we use the primitives of the C# language to represent the parts of submodels. Submodels and Submodel Element Collections Submodels and Submodel Element Collections represent structure types in the language specification. In general, these types are realized as classes and records. Submodel Elements At the moment, we provide support for the following set of submodel elements. For each of these types we provide type that performs additional correctness checks at creation, and, potentially, provides additional helper methods. ReferenceElement : representation of a ReferenceElement. Files : the library provides two abstractions to represent files FileReference : generic representation of a file that may reference files anywhere, including external URLs. PackageFileReference : special file representation. Use this, if you want to create a package for which a file should be included. MultiLanguageString : Multi Language Property. Properties and Lists For both, properties, and lists, are realized using the suitable C# primitives. Builders twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels employs the builder pattern \u29c9 for most of the composed types. These builders allow the step-wise collection of properties necessary for the creation of an object. To create an object with a builder, the workflow thereby is as follows: construction of the builder with mandatory arguments set or add attributes via Add* (for list elements) or With* for single attributes. finally, construct the actual type via a call to Build() . The builders follow the approach described in design principles : they apply constraints in their constructors, setters, and in the build method, to ensure validity and consistency of input data. As shown with the DigitalNameplateBuilder you can use method chaining to fill in properties: // 1. construction of the Builder with its necessary attributes var digitalNameplateBuilder = new DigitalNameplateBuilder( \"nameplate-C4022\", \"https://conplement.de/test\", \"conplement AG\".ToMultiLanguageString(), \"internal-product\".ToMultiLanguageString(), new ContactInformation( \"DE\".ToMultiLanguageString(), \"N\u00fcrnberg\".ToMultiLanguageString(), \"S\u00fcdwestpark 92G\".ToMultiLanguageString(), \"90449\".ToMultiLanguageString() ), \"2025\"); // 2. providing some additional attributes digitalNameplateBuilder .WithHardwareVersion(\"en\", \"1.0.0\") .WithFirmwareVersion(\"en\", \"0.1.0\") .WithSoftwareVersion(\"en\", \"0.2.3\"); // 3. finally construct the digital nameplate var digitalNameplate = digitalNameplateBuilder.Build(); Important As complex objects are passed into the builder by reference, it is not safe to reuse a builder for the creation of multiple objects. Validation There are extensive validation mechanisms in twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels to check whether submodel instances are valid with respect to their submodel templates. Besides model specific checks, twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels provides validations for: missing mandatory submodel elements unknown submodel elements unset (mandatory) attributes in submodel elements correct cardinality of submodel elements valid type representation of properties Note The page on validations contains an exhaustive list of the respective validations with descriptions. Each submodel type exposes a validator class that can be used to validate instances of the submodel. These validators return enumerators with the found validation errors: using AasCore.Aas3_0; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Submodels.DigitalNameplate.V2_0; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Submodels.DigitalNameplate.V2_0.Validation; Aas3_0.ISubmodel digitalNameplateMetamodel; // ... load a Digital Nameplate from some source, e.g., from a repository. var errors = DigitalNameplateValidator.Validate(digitalNameplateMetamodel); if (errors.Count() == 0) { Console.WriteLine(\"\u2728 Correct Digital Nameplate.\") } else { Console.WriteError(\"\ud83d\udc1b Broken Digital Nameplate:\") foreach (var error in errors) { Console.WriteError(error.Reason); } } Note These validations are to be understood as an extension of the terrific validations provided by the aas_core_works team. Whereas the validations in the AasCore SDK addresses the correctness of shells and submodels on syntactical level, the validations in twinsphere.TypedMetaModels are instead concerned with the correctness of submodels in respect to their respective submodel templates, i.e., whether submodels fulfill the requirements given by their submodel templates. Thus, the validation is limited to submodel instances. Conversion The twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels library provides the means to convert between ( valid ) models in the generic meta model representation and the typed submodel, and vice versa. To this end, submodels implement FromMetamodel() and ToMetamodel() : using AasCore.Aas3_0; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Types.Submodels.DigitalNameplate.V2_0; Aas3_0.ISubmodel digitalNameplateMetamodel; // ... load a Digital Nameplate from some source, e.g., from a repository. // 1. convert to its typed representation DigitalNameplate digitalNameplate; try { digitalNameplate = DigitalNameplate.FromMetamodel(digitalNameplateMetamodel); } catch (SubmodelConversionException conversionException) { Console.Error($\"Failed to convert from erroneous submodel: {conversionException}\"); } // 2. perform operations on the Digital Nameplate digitalNameplate.SoftwareVersion = \"1.0.0\".ToMultiLanguageString(\"en\"); // ... // 3. convert the DigitalNameplate back digitalNameplateMetamodel = digitalNameplate.ToMetamodel(); try { digitalNameplateMetamodel = digitalNameplate.ToMetamodel(); } catch (SubmodelConversionException conversionException) { Console.Error($\"Failed to convert to metamodel: {conversionException}\"); } Note FromMetamodel() will use the validation mechanism to check whether the submodel is a valid instance of its SMT. If it is not, it will throw a SubmodelConversionException with the encountered errors. Additional Features Besides the dedicated submodel support mechanisms, twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels provides some further general-purpose utilities to simplify the work with submodels. Value-only Semantics Besides the heavy meta model specification, the IDTA, furthermore, provides a specification for the so-called \"Value-only Semantics\". The Value-only Semantics describes a stripped down representation for meta models. The twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels library allows to convert arbitrary submodels, i.e., also for submodels not listed in the supported submodels to the value-only representation. using AasCore.Aas3_0; using twinsphere.TypedAasMetamodels.Conversion.ValueOnly; Aas3_0.ISubmodel digitalNameplateMetamodel; // ... load a Digital Nameplate from some source, e.g., from a repository. var jsonString = ValueOnlySerializer.ToValueOnly(digitalNameplateMetamodel); Caveats and Notes on Usage Deviations From SMT Specifications In some cases the library deviates from the properties as described in the officially released SMTs. These changes are typically editorial in nature to fix issues in the SMTs. We adopt editorial changes if we can easily identify what the SMT should look like if it was correct, even if these changes are not part of the official SMT specifications (yet). We chose this strategy to provide users with the ability to create valid submodels as early as possible. You can find a detailed list of these changes in the overview of the supported submodels .

Definition of meta models for selected submodels, such as Digital Nameplate. Offering packaging functionality based on the.aasx format. In its design, the library is designed to make the creation of shells and submodels as easy, as possible, while reducing sources of potential errors where possible. To this end, it employs some basic design rules: Use distinct types where possible: Submodels are class citizens: where possible (i.e., where submodel templates are not ambiguous), submodels and their submodel elements are modelled, individual types. Enums to encode restricted properties. Prevent illegal states where possible, both, with respect to the meta model specification, as well as, to the submodel template specification: At compile time via signatures: creation methods enforce mandatory arguments, preventing incomplete submodel elements. At runtime time via fail-fast principle: constraints enforce correct types and qualifiers, e.g., the number of elements in lists. At runtime in conversion: meta models are validated in conversion. Validation errors cause the conversion to fail early. Hide metadata from the user: any SMT metadata, such as SemanticIds, IdShorts, ValueTypes, ... is handled internally.

In both cases, users may use SubmodelElementCollections (SMCs) as structuring elements, e.g., to provide additional nesting in UIs. To this end, this SMT defines two different types of SMCs: Section and ArbitrarySMC , both are considered to act as arbitrary properties, i.e., properties for which the user may choose an id short, as well as, semantic ids. At the moment, however, there is no way to tell a Section element from any other SMC element in their respective context. In the library we therefore do have a Section element for the creation of the submodel. However, it is currently impossible to load an instance of this submodel from metamodel and to retrieve Section elements. Furthermore, there currently are some additional modeling issues with this SMT: the SMT describes the ProductClassifications , TechnicalPropertyAreas , and SpecialDescriptions by qualifiers as lists of lists. This likely is a modeling error. As of now we interpret this as an error and interpret these individual elements as singular elements.

This omission from the spec is likely due to an error, rather than intentionally. However, until the spec is fixed or an official statement has been made, we chose to follow the spec by also omitting these checks from the SDK. Supported submodel specific constraints : Document::DocumentClassification The classification according to VDI 2770 Blatt 1:2020 is mandatory in the Submodel Handover Documentation.

It consists of two parts: in the first part general structural rules are discussed. The second part describes validations that are specific for individual submodel types. Example Validations are described in this document in the form of rules. Each rule entry consists of the same parts: a unique rule name a description of the respective rule General Rules Name not set for property. Can't convert object models without valid id short The id short of a submodel element is not set, although it is not an element of a submodel element list. Each submodel element in the submodel (except for submodel element list elements) is expected to have an id short to facilitate correct interpretation. Submodel element has elements with duplicate id shorts There are multiple submodel elements in the same namespace that have the same id short. As per AASd-022 \u29c9 , id shorts of non-identifiables must be unique within their respective namespace. Submodel element has wrong type, expected XYZ The type of submodel element differs from that, that the submodel template describes. Submodel element has unset value Submodel elements in submodel instances are expected to carry a non-empty value. Optional unset submodel elements should be signified by elision from the submodel. Note For a submodel element to be optional, it must have a SMT/Cardinality qualifier like ZeroToOne or ZeroToMany . File has unset ContentType File elements in submodel instances are expected to carry a non-empty ContentType. Optional unset file elements should be signified by elision from the submodel. Note For a submodel element to be optional, it must have a SMT/Cardinality qualifier like ZeroToOne or ZeroToMany . MimeType of a File must be correct The content type specified in a file element does not match to the content type derived by referenced file's extension. File specified ContentType does not match that of file reference The content type specified in a file element does not match to the content type derived by referenced file's extension. Property has wrong value type, expected XYZ The value type of a property element does not match the value type described in the submodel template. If the submodel template demands a specific value type, instances of the property must adhere to said value type. Property Value is invalid. Cannot be interpreted as XYZ The value of a property element cannot correctly be interpreted as a value of the value type specified in the property. Property value is not supported by constraints The value of a property element does not adhere to constraints as given by qualifiers or the submodel template specification. This, for example, is the case if the property acts as a sort of enumeration with a limited set of valid values. Unknown property for instance of XYZ The submodel template does not specify a property with the id short of this submodel element. Missing mandatory property for instance of XYZ The submodel instance lacks a submodel element that the submodel template specifies with the qualifier SMT/Cardinality of One . Missing list elements for XYZ for instance of XYZ The number of elements in submodel element list in the submodel instance does not match the minimum number of elements as specified in the SMT/Cardinality qualifier for the list in the submodel template. Id must be set and non-empty The id of a submodel is unset. Submodel Specific Rules Submodel specific rules are rules and restrictions that are specific to individual submodel templates.
