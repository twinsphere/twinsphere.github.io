!!! note
    **Work in Progress**
    This section is still under construction.
    Our keyboards are clacking, our coffee is strong, and the content is on its way.
    Thanks for your patience!

## General Information

If there are more entries than displayed a *load more* button is visible at the bottom of the list.
Each load will add up to 50 entries.

Every catalog has a *refresh* button which reloads the first 50 entries with the selected
filters if any are available and set.

![Catalog Id column](img/twinstudio_catalog_id.png){: width='400'}

Each **id** column contains a button that displays the shortened id.
On click the full id is shown and can be copied to your clipboard.

**Version** is only displayed if the version of the entry's administration is set,
else there is just a *"-"* visible.
If no revision is given it will be assumed as *0*.

## ... of Twins

The catalog of twins has a toggle on top to switch between *asset administration shells* and *submodels*.

### asset administration shells

The quick filter at the top allows you to display only the shells of the selected **asset kind**.
On the right a filter for the shells can be set. All text searches are case insensitiv.
In the submodel column the count of submodels is displayed
and on click it opens a dialog where the submodels are listed with some basic information.

## ... of Concept Descriptions

In this catalog the data specification column you can see which specifications
are set in the concept description. Only *IEC61360* is displayed by name.
Every other specification is labeled as unknown because it was not specified by the **idta**.
If it is a *IEC61360* specification you can inspect this by clicking on the *eye* button.

## ... of Drafts

Currently only your personal **twin drafts** are shown here. The state column shows if your draft has issues or is valid.
The rows are ordered by the *last modified* column.

## ... of Submodel Tempates

This catalog displays all *submodels* that are of **kind** **template**.
