  in-depth technical knowledge required. This saves time, costs, and reduces errors.
- **Standards-compliant & future-proof:** Compliant with the IDTA standard for seamless, cross-company collaboration and
  maximum process efficiency.
- **Scalable & reusable:** Blueprints and submodel templates ensure a consistent Digital Twin strategy and simplify
  expansion to new products and business areas.
