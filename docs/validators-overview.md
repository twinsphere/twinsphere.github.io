## twinsphere twinfix

A publicly accessible web tool at <https://twinfix.twinsphere.io>.

twinfix analyzes an uploaded AASX package and displays all validation errors found grouped by error class. It offers a
help screen for many of the common errors including links to relevant parts of the specification and a recommendation on
what to do to address the issue.

For some errors it even has the power to apply a fix automatically!
